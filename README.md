# FizzBuzz
When variable (i) encounters a number divisible by 3 outputs "Fizz!", when the number is divisible by 5, outputs "Buzz!". When the number is divisible by both, the output is "FizzBuzz!". Anything else outputs only the number. The program uses a FOR loop, processing numbers between 1 and 100.
